# Chem Chat
My Fall 2019 project.

(incomplete) C telnet/netcat server that was supposed to help me pass my Honors Chemistry 10 class.

Based off of another similar (incomplete) project I made in the summer of 2019, that would emulate the card game "Monopoly Deal".

## Getting Started

#### Installing

Clone the repo, and run the Makefile:

```
git clone https://github.com/SnootierMoon/ChemChat.git
cd ChemChat
make
```

#### Running the server

Unlike the Monopoly Deal server, this creates an executable called 'out' which starts the server. The port is 42069.

#### Connecting a client and Other Stuff

Read the instructions from the old [Monopoly Deal README file](https://github.com/SnootierMoon/MonopolyDeal#getting-started).

#### Screenshot of functionality

My goal was to make this easy to use for Chem grinding, but, I kind of just... didn't. Oops!

## TODO

Finish it.
